# Core-CS-Algorithms
## Implement core computer science algorithms in Python or Java
* The graph algorithms are fundamental to computer science. We implement minimize spanning tree algorithms such as Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. 
  * Optimize running time of Prim's with min-heap.
  * Streamline implementation of Kruskal's with union-find.
* Iterative binary tree traversals.
* Classic dynamic programming (dp) problems and solutions.
  * Implemented Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm with negative-weighted edges.
