# Computer Science Algorithms
## Classic computer science algorithms
* Graph algorithms are fundamental to computer science. We implement minimize spanning tree algorithms such as Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. 
  * Optimize running time of Prim's with min-heap.
  * Streamline implementation of Kruskal's with union-find.
  * Topological sort.
* Iterative binary tree traversals.
* Classic dynamic programming (DP) problems and solutions.
  * Implemented Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm with negative-weighted edges.
* Classic combinatorial problem of Eight Queens.

## Advanced data structures
* Red-black tree
* Radix tree
